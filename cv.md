## Summary
I want to study in RS School and become Frontend Developer.  
I have just a few key principles in life that I try to follow. Here are my rules for human life:  
*1. Do not do anything from the “because” paradigm, but only “in order to.” If an action has a reason but no purpose, then it is a weak action.*  
*2. If you want to get cooperation, make sure that this cooperation is beneficial to the other party. This is the rule of life for successful people.*  
*3. In any situation, when emotions run wild and uncontrollably provoke the standard rash act - take a break. Walk 30 minutes and the situation will look completely different.*
